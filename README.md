# TicTacToe_MinimaxAlgo
Tic Tac Toe implementation in c++


Here,It is a basic implementation of Minimax algorithm in c++ leading to an AI which is pretty good in it's game

Till Now,I had implemented it in serial manner so it might be a little bit of predictive for somme of the moves.
Because it doesn't choose the first Max valued move which looks like repeating same moves.

NOTE : This code might not work in windows OS , so change line 41 from *system("clear")* to *system("CLS")*

But wait,Try to win.
